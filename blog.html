            Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to
            those who prepare for it today. An investment in knowledge pays the
            best interest. The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is
            sweet. Education is about empowerment, about cultivating a human
            being to the highest possible potential- a tool for fulfilling the
            immensity of being. Education is not about loading the child's mind
            with information, but about making it capable of razor-sharp
            perception, capable of knowing life in its full depth and dimension.
            Education should not be about molding children the way you want
            them, but about supporting their natural longing to know.

            is about making a child grow with an uncluttered intelligence. An
            intelligence that is not identified and entangled in culture,
            ideology or prejudice will naturally lead to the ultimate blossoming
            of the individual
